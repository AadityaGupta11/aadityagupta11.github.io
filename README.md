## FAQs:
1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
Markdown is simple and fast. It is a lightweight text language with simple writing and editing. Markdown uses fewer formatting options and provides more accessibility to the user. Markdown is less distracting, with almost no toolbar present, and the mouse clicks are also reduced so the user can keep their hands on the keyboard and be productive and have structured content writing. It provides a seamless experience with more control and less autocorrect features. According to Etter's book,"Technical writing should be tailored to the audience's needs and knowledge level", doesn't matteer the interface.

2. Why is my resume not showing up?
Usually, when files are dragged onto the GitHub page, they are instantly visible. However, if the user is working with a certain set of settings, then they will need to change it by going to the repository setting. Or worst case scenario, that the Github servers are down. Please wait for a few minutes and refresh the page, and it will appear.

3. Can you add more than one file at once, including your resume, on the same repository?
Yes, more than one file can be added to the same repository, including your resume. The user can add a specific document or a specific file, and they can also add a whole folder from their system. Just follow the instructions given above, and the file/folder will be added to the same repository.
